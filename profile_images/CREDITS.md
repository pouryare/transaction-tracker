## Profile Pictures

All profile pictures used in this project were generated using [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/), a website that generates realistic-looking faces using artificial intelligence (StyleGAN).

### About This Person Does Not Exist

- The website uses AI to create photorealistic images of people who don't actually exist
- Each image is unique and generated using a deep learning model
- These images are free to use and help protect privacy by not using real people's photos
- Created by Philip Wang using StyleGAN technology developed by Nvidia

### Usage in SecureBank

The following profile images were generated using this technology:

- Ava.jpg
- Charlotte.jpg
- Emma.jpg
- Evelyn.jpg
- Isabella.jpg
- Mia.jpg
- Olivia.jpg
- Sophia.jpg

> Note: These AI-generated images are used for demonstration purposes only. In a real banking application, users would upload their own profile pictures.

## Legal Notice

The use of AI-generated profile pictures in this project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. In a production environment, proper user verification and real profile pictures would be required for security purposes.
